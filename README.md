TaskMate is built using a modern, scalable, and maintainable architecture focused on performance and best practices.

### 🧩 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵

- 🎨 **UI** : [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is used for building the entire user interface. This allows for a declarative, concise, and powerful way to create beautiful and responsive layouts.
- 🧭 **Navigation** : [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) handles all the in-app navigation, providing a consistent and predictable user flow.
- ⚙️ **Asynchronous Programming** : We use [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) extensively for managing background operations, ensuring the UI remains responsive and smooth.
- 💾 **Data Persistence** : For lightweight data storage like user preferences, we leverage [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore).
- 🎞️ **Animations** : To enhance the user experience, we've integrated [Lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/) for beautiful, high-quality animations that make the app feel alive.
- 🔔 **Background Processing** : Critical background tasks like sending notifications are handled by [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager), guaranteeing execution even if the app is in the background or the device restarts.
